# Using `location` - this one needs to be looked at

We can also use the `location` prop with the `Routes` component. When we provide a path to the `location` prop, no matter which URL a user tries to go, browser navigates to the path that we provided to the `location` prop.

In the below example, we set the `location` to `/books`. No matter which URL a user tries to go, browser will render the same components that we specified for the path `/books`.

```js
import { Link, Route, Routes } from "react-router-dom";
import Home from "./pages/Home";
import BookList from "./pages/BookList";
import Book from "./pages/Book";
import NewBook from "./pages/NewBook";
import NotFound from "./pages/NotFound";
import BookLayout from "./BookLayout";

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Routes location="/books">
        <Route path="/books" element={<h1>Extra Content</h1>} />
      </Routes>

      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <Link to="/">Home</Link>
          </li>
          <li>
            <Link to="/books">Books</Link>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </nav>

      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/books" element={<BookLayout />}>
          <Route index element={<BookList />} />
          <Route path=":id" element={<Book />} />
          <Route path="new" element={<NewBook />} />
        </Route>
        <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
      </Routes>
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
```
